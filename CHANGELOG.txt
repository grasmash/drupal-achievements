Achievements 7.x-1.1, 2011-xx-xx
--------------------------------
@todo Revise the README and project page with the relevants from below.

 * Achievements can now have images.
  * Three possible display states: locked, unlocked, and hidden.
  * Admins may set the default images at admin/config/people/achievements.
  * An 'images' array has been added to hook_achievements_info() definitions.
  * Per-achievement images can override the default on a per-state basis.
  * CSS tweaks were made for a more flexible achievement display.
 * Administrators can now manually give and take achievements from users.
  * It's problematic on progression-based achievements and internal statistics.
  * hook_achievements_info() gets 'storage' to define where statistics are kept.
  * If 'storage' is not specified, assume it exists under the achievement ID.
  * See admin/config/people/achievements for the disclaimer text on usage.
  * See achievements.api.php for more on 'storage' and a revised HOWTO.
 * A new permission, "Earn achievements", has been added.
  * It is REQUIRED and NECESSARY for all roles that can unlock achievements.
  * Core functions check for it so you shouldn't need it in your own code.
  * If you think you need to check, use achievements_user_is_achiever().
  * Removing this permission from a role does NOT delete data or ranks.
  * It does stop, however, the collection of new data, points, or unlocks.
 * achievements/leaderboard/NONEXISTENT now returns a 404.
 * Locked achievements are now displayed on a user's achievements tab.
 * No more warnings when viewing a user with no achievement unlocks.
 * 'id' is no longer duplicated in hook_achievements_info() definitions.
 * achievements.tpl.php has had its PHP moved to template_preprocess_hook().


Achievements 7.x-1.0, 2011-07-07
