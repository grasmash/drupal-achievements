Achievements 7.x-1.1, 2011-xx-XX
--------------------------------
 * A new permission, "Earn achievements", has been added.
  * It is REQUIRED and NECESSARY for all roles that can unlock achievements.
  * Core functions check for it so you shouldn't need it in your own code.
  * If you think you need to check, use achievements_user_is_achiever().
  * Removing this permission from a role does NOT delete data or ranks.
  * It does stop, however, the collection of new data, points, or unlocks.


Achievements 7.x-1.0, 2011-07-07
--------------------------------
 * First release for Drupal 7.x.
