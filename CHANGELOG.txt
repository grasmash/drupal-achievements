Achievements 7.x-1.3, 2011-xx-xx
--------------------------------
* (todo) Go through and add hooks and alters for the various thingies. Doc.
* (todo) Add a "get latest badge" thing for lookups, add to leaderboard?


 * Relative leaderboards have been added.
  * The block and global leaderboard can now show user-specific stats.
  * The current user's ranking can be displayed, along with "nearby" users.
  * "Nearby" users are a number of ranks before and after the current user.
  * The number of nearby ranks shown can be 0 through 10.
  * The block and global leaderboard can be configured separately.
 * New leaderboard CSS class added: achievements-leaderboard-current-user.
 * The achievements/leaderboard is now a paged view instead of a set limit.
  * Control number of ranks per page at admin/config/people/achievements/.
 * achievements_totals() no longer exists; moved inline to leaderboard page.
 * achievements_totals_user() has been rewritten with different parameters.
 * We now load all of a user's unlocks in achievements_unlocked_already().
  * This is then cached for all future lookups during that page load.
  * a_u_a and a_u can be called a lot per page for heavy achievement sites.
  * Loading all and caching is better, performance-wise, then lots of singles.
 * Issue #1274350 by makononov: added query tags for the leaderboards.
 * Fixed some warnings that appeared in a first-time installation.


Achievements 7.x-1.2, 2011-09-07
--------------------------------
 * Achievement unlock notifications are now JS fadeins and offline-able.
  * We no longer use drupal_set_message() to inform of an unlock.
  * A new achievement-notification.tpl.php controls the appearance.
  * Unlock notifications now fade in and out at the window's bottom right.
  * We now track whether a user has seen an achievement unlock notification.
  * If they haven't, they will the next time they login or access the site.
 * Leaderboard top rank counts can now be tweaked in the relevant configs.
  * This is in preparation for "relative leaderboards" planned for 7.x-1.3.
 * Unlocked achievements on user/#/achievements can now be unsorted.
  * That is, instead of "move to top" they can remain "as defined in code".
  * Defaults to "move to top". Config at admin/config/people/achievements.
 * Block 'achievements-leaderboard' renamed with underscores not dashes.
  * If you're using this block, you'll need to place it again upon upgrade.
 * Fixed a few PHP warnings when a user has yet to unlock any achievements.
 * Achievement unlocks are now logged in watchdog.
 * Variables are now properly deleted on uninstall.


Achievements 7.x-1.1, 2011-07-18
--------------------------------
 * Achievements can now be categorized into groups.
  * Grouped achievements will be displayed within jQuery UI tabs.
  * If groups exist, ungrouped achievements "upgrade" automatically.
  * See achievements.api.php for more on how to define achievement groups.
 * Achievements can now have images.
  * Three possible display states: locked, unlocked, and hidden.
  * Admins may set the default images at admin/config/people/achievements.
  * An 'images' array has been added to hook_achievements_info() definitions.
  * Per-achievement images can override the default on a per-state basis.
  * CSS tweaks were made for a more flexible achievement display.
  * Default images have been provided for each of the three states.
 * Administrators can now manually give and take achievements from users.
  * It's problematic on progression-based achievements and internal statistics.
  * hook_achievements_info() gets 'storage' to define where statistics are kept.
  * If 'storage' is not specified, assume it exists under the achievement ID.
  * See admin/config/people/achievements for the disclaimer text on usage.
  * See achievements.api.php for more on 'storage' and a revised HOWTO.
 * A new permission, "Earn achievements", has been added.
  * It is REQUIRED and NECESSARY for all roles that can unlock achievements.
  * Core functions check for it so you shouldn't need it in your own code.
  * If you think you need to check, use achievements_user_is_achiever().
  * Removing this permission from a role does NOT delete data or ranks.
  * It does stop, however, the collection of new data, points, or unlocks.
 * achievements/leaderboard/NONEXISTENT now returns a 404.
 * Locked achievements are now displayed on a user's achievements tab.
 * No more warnings when viewing a user with no achievement unlocks.
 * 'id' is no longer duplicated in hook_achievements_info() definitions.
 * achievements.tpl.php has had its PHP moved to template_preprocess_hook().
  * New variables have been added to streamline the display code.


Achievements 7.x-1.0, 2011-07-07
--------------------------------
 * First release for Drupal 7.x.
